# invoice-cum-monthly-calculater-estimation
This application serves the purpose of generating an invoice for the purchases made by the customer. It further calculates the EMI that the customer is supposed to pay according to the interest rate. The application asks for the product names and their respective prices. It further asks the user to enter the company information, including name and address. It then asks for the sales tax and generates the total amount due. Part 2, asks about the down payment that the customer is willing to pay and the interest rate that will be charged. It then calculates the EMI that the customer will be paying monthly. The output will systematically generate all the above information using ASCII. The project involved concepts of python basics, data displays, and best practices.
